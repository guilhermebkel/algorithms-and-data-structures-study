## Fundamentals

### Bags, Queues and Stacks

- **Bags:** A bag is a collection where removing items is not supported. Its purpose is to provide clients the ability to collect items and then to iterate through them. The order of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client.

- **FIFO Queues:** A FIFO queue is a collection based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) policy. So, it means we use it to do tasks in the same order that they arrive.

- **Pushdown Stacks:** A pushdown stack is a collection that is based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) policy. So, it means we use it to do tasks taking always the top item of the collection.
